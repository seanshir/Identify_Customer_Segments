# Identify_Customer_Segments
There are two main sources of data: Demographics data of a general population and data of current customers. Comparing these datasets can help with targeting for a marketing campaign. <br>

• Data Preprocessing: Using Python Pandas, created a Cleaning Function to handle missing data and perform feature trimming, re-encoding, and engineering for the datasets. <br>

• Feature Transformation: Using Python sklearn, applied feature scaling and performed dimensionality reduction using PCA and interpreted the principal components. <br>

• Clustering: Using Python sklearn, applied K-Means clustering to general population data, and used a scree-plot to obtain the best number of clusters. <br>

• Finally, mapped the customer data to the created clusters and by some visualizations, the over-represented clusters in the customers data in comparison to general population were identified. These over-represented clusters can be targeted for future marketing campaigns. <br>
